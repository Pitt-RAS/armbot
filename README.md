## roadmap
- Week 1-2 - Develop algorithm to change gyro values to angles and then to 3d space

- Week 3-4 - Develop and test data transfer method
- Week 4-5 - Develop and test algorithm to translate 3d space to hydraulic control

 note: above timeline is extremely tentative, it is more of a rough outline rather than hard deadlines

## repository structure
### brain
- unpack sensor data
- translate sensor data to robot movements
- runs on raspberry pi

### sensors
- package and transmit sensor data to the raspberry pi
- runs on arduino uno
